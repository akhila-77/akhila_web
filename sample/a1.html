Go to your react project folder and :
- Configue your local repositories
Commands :
-> git init
-> git clone codelink

Suppose you created a project folder with name "reactprojects" on your desktop

NOW, IN YOUR PROJECT FOLDER : (/Desktop/reactprojects)

YOU WILL FIND A FOLDER WITH SAME NAME AS YOUR REPOSITORY NAME, ALONG WITH THE .git FOLDER

Path : /Desktop/reactprojects
Files :
- .git
- repository name

GO INSIDE THAT FOLDER (the repository name folder)

Now, your path should be :

Path : /Desktop/reactprojects/repositoryname

--- OPEN A NEW GIT BASH PROMPT IN THIS FOLDER ---

--- NOW ONWARDS, YOUR PATH IN GIT BASH SHOULD SHOW : /Desktop/reactprojects/repostioryname (in the last) ---

--- YOU WILL HAVE TO UPLOAD ALL THE FILE, PERFORM ALL THE COMMANDS AND DO ALL THE UPDATIONS HERE ONLY ---
